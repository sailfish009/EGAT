1. [Python 3.6 or later version](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2. [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/#start-locally)
3. [Deep Graph Library](https://github.com/dmlc/dgl)


## Download pretrained-model weights:
### ProtBERT model weight
1. Please download the pretrained model weight-file "pytorch_model.bin" from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/10MLado6OTLtQ_RWbBEyZNaPCVXaCf73z/view?usp=sharing).
2. Place this weight-file in the folder "EGAT/inputs/ProtBert_model".
If you use this pretrained model for your paper, please cite the paper [ProtTrans: Towards Cracking the Language of Lifeâ€™s Code Through Self-Supervised Deep Learning and High Performance Computing](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.12.199554v2)
### EGAT model weight
1. Please download the pretrained model weight-file "egat_model_weight.dat" from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1KsbJ6x8y_8YneO29d81khIhXwt57SWwz/view?usp=sharing).
2. Place this weight-file in the folder "EGAT/models".

## Input Data
To store input-features, navigate to the folder "EGAT/inputs". In this folder, follow any of the following steps:
1. Store the PDB files of the isolated proteins that shall be used for prediction in the folder "pdb_files". Rename the PDB files in the format: "\<an arbritary name\>\_\<chain IDs\>". Please see the example PDB files provided in this folder. Please provide the real chain IDs (as available in the PDB file) after the underscore ("\_") correctly. (In the provided examples \<an arbritary name\> is the PDB ID of a complex in which this input protein is one of the subunits. It is not mendatory.)
2. List all the protein-names in the file "protein_list.txt"

## Run inference to predict numeric propensity (of each of the residues) for interaction
1. From command line cd to "EGAT" folder (where the "run_egat.py" file is situated).
2. Please run the following command:
```python
python run_egat.py
```
3. The command above will generate the results in the "EGAT/outputs" folder.

# Output format
1. The output generated by running EGAT will be stored as a [*pickle file*](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html) in the "EGAT/outputs" folder. To open the pickle file please run the following commands in the python interpreter:
  ```python
  import pickle
  output = pickle.load(open('EGAT/outputs/prediction_and_attention_scores.pkl', 'rb'))
  ```
2. In the above commands the *"output"* variable is a [*python dictionary*](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#dictionaries) (with the four keys: 'pred', 'protein_info', 'edges', 'attention_scores').  
  - To access the predicted numeric propensity, please run the following commands:  
    ```python
    prediction = output['pred']  
    protein_index = 0  
    print(prediction[protein_index])  
    ```
    In the above commands, "protein_index" represents the index of the protein-name in the "protein_list.txt" file. (You can set it to any number, e.g: for the protein-name at index 2 (third row of the "protein_list.txt" file), set protein_index=2).  
    These commands will print the predicted numeric propensities of all the residues in the protein at index "0" of "protein_list.txt" file. The propensities will be printed sequentially following the order of the residues in the input PDB file of this protein.  

  - To access general information about the input proteins, please run the following commands:  
    ```python
    protein_information = output['protein_info']  
    protein_index = 0  
    print(protein_information[protein_index])    
    ```
    These commands will print a [*python dictionary*](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#dictionaries) corresponding to the protein at index "0" of "protein_list.txt" file. This python dictionary contains the number of residues in the protein (represented with the key 'seq_length' in this dictionary).  

  - To access the edges of the graphs representions of the input proteins, please run the following commands:  
    ```python
    graph_edges = output['edges']  
    protein_index = 0  
    print(graph_edges[protein_index])  
    ```
    These commands will print a [*numpy array*](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.array.html) corresponding to the protein at index "0" of "protein_list.txt" file. Each row of this *numpy array* corresponds to a *neighborhood*, that contains the indices of the neighboring nodes (residues) of one residue (i.e. *the center of the neighborhood*). (please see [our paper]() for more details). This *center of the neighborhood* is the row count of the matrix. The following example command will print the *neighborhood* (neighboring residue indices) of the residue with index *2* -  
    ```python
    center_node = 2  
    print(graph_edges[protein_index][center_node])  
    ```
  
  - To access the attention scores associated with the edges, please run the following commands:  
    ```python
    attention_scores = output['attention_scores']  
    protein_index = 0  
    print(attention_scores[protein_index])  
    ```
    These commands will print a [*numpy array*](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.array.html) corresponding to the protein at index "0" of "protein_list.txt" file. Each row of this *numpy array* contains the attention scores associated with the corresponding edge. In the following example command, *center of the neighborhood* is the residue at position *2*. This command will print the attention scores associated with the edges from its neighboring residues (nodes) to this residue-  
    ```python
    center_node = 2  
    print(attention_scores[protein_index][center_node])  
    ```
